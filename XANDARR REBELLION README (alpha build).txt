XANDARR REBELLION ALPHA BUILD
=============================

- player collides with the edges of the screen

- no scrolling yet

- player image is smaller than the actual player image size so boundary collisions look off

- enemy moves left and right

- no player to enemy collisions yet

- tiling implemented, but only renders one tile over and over



Move player
-----------

W,A,S,D keys



EDIT: It took me a while to merge the project pieces. Everything kept breaking because I didn't piece them together one by one... u_u
